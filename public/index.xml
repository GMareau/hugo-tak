      <description>&lt;p&gt;In preparation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilelean.eu&#34;&gt;Agile Lean Europe 2018&lt;/a&gt; in Zurich, the attendees have been invited by the fantastic organizers to a zoom call to open the space. During this call, the question about introversion in an open space event has been raised but not answered. It got me thinking. “How is it to be an introvert at ALE?”. If we’ve met, you probably have noticed that I’m on the introversion part of the spectrum. It’s also my third participation in a row. This is my “survival guide” based on my own experience.
