The goal is to shoot as many portraits as I can of people from agile and lean. By zooming in the individuals, I want to explore the diversity of those that are forming our communities.


 >“**Agile kaleidoscope** noun
>A constantly changing and enjoyable mixture of what matters the most: people.”



I’m checking in a bit nervous about this journey since I’m not a professional photographer nor interviewer. I’m also quite a shy person. Meeting new people, connect with them and capture a great shot will, without a doubt, pull me out of my comfort zone.  At the same time, I’m feeling very positive. I’ll contribute to our communities by living two of my passions: agile and photography. I can’t tell where it’s going to carry me, but I know I’ll grow along the way.
