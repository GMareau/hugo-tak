His experience with the Liberating Structure [Troika Consulting](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/8-troika-consulting/) reminded him that the simplest solutions are often the better and that it is easier to step back when you're not the one impacted by a problem.

The sense of urgency mentioned by [Leo](/portfolio/atam17/leo) in his keynote also resonated strongly with him.
