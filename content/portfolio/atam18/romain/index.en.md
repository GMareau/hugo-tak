Romain is an agile coach aka agility enabler.
<!--more-->

With him, I discovered the [Cynefin Lego Game](https://www.agile42.com/en/training/cynefin-lego-game/) during my very first agile meetup and some time later, an implementation of the [Moving Motivators](https://management30.com/practice/moving-motivators/) too. Nice memories...

On the slate, you can read "Je n'aime pas les barbus !" / "I don't like bearded people!". I have no idea why he wrote that... I'm always happy to see him.

He's a fellow organizer of Agile Tour Aix-Marseille with [Yvan](/portfolio/atam17/yvan) and [Fran√ßois](/portfolio/atam18/francois).
