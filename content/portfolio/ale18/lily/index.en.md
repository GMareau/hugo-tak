I can vouch for Lily's parrot skills!

<!--more-->
The very first exchange we had was a bit odd. We participated in a session on shyness and how to overcome it.
For a couple minutes, we acted like parrot for the other. One said everything nice he wanted to hear from someone else about him, and the other repeated it back to him. It was both uncomfortable AND felt so good!

Thank you Lily for this little moment of kindness.
