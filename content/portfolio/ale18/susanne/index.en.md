What can I say about Susanne?
<!--more-->

Sounds like a simple question and yet I'm struggling to find what is the most important to share about her here. Should I say something about the time we walked very very very slowly in the streets of Prague? or about her simple attention that allowed me to start taking all the portraits I've share from ALE18? I just can't decide.

Wait! Have I mentioned her awesome project: [Alps to Alaska](https://www.alps2alaska.com/)

Oh and that she might be called "Not [Sylvia](/portfolio/ale18/sylvia/)" as well.
