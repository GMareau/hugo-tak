Picture a book [^1], a cosy chair in a unoccupied space overlooking the main unconference space.

Picture this mixture of calm, resourcing, while being bathed by the energy, excitement, of the event.

It was in this context that I met Alexander and we had a little chat. It is precisely the kind of moment and meeting that brings me back to ALE every year.

[^1]: Which book is not very important but if you ask yourself the question it was David Marquet's "Turn the ship around". I highly recommend it.
