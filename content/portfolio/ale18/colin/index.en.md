Colin is a surgeon and a facilitator in collective intelligence.

When he introduced himself as a surgeon in the Open Space at ALE Paris in 2016, I was surprised to say the least and honestly wondered what he was doing here.

The truth is, every year since then, he has brought his point of view, which is a non-agilist, non-it one but simply a human one. He's contributing to the growing diversity of the community and that's invaluable. Thank you, Colin.

Just after ALE 18 started the school year of a project that he built from all his heart and I invite you to check it out: [The Fox and the Rose] (https://le-renard-et-la-rose.fr).
