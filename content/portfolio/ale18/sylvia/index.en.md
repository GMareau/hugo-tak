Sylvia is an agile coach in Germany.

I met her in Prague over tacos and unless my memory is failing me, I think [David](/portfolio/ale18/david) was there too.

I had the chance to practice Liberating Structures with her a couple times. I especially remember a session of Tro√Øka Consulting in the open air with the sound of a river as a background noise. It's another one of those simple moments that bring me back to ALE every year.

I'm pretty sure we shared the quiet zone at ALE18 too or was it [Not Sylvia](/portfolio/ale18/susanne)?
