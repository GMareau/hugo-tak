David is another person I had the pleasure of meeting during a Dinner with Strangers in Prague in 2017.

You probably can't tell from the picture but like me he is one of the introverts who participate and come back at ALE every year (see [ALE introvert survival guide](/blog/2018/08/ale-introvert-guide/))!

This photo was taken just after a thought-provoking discussion on Clean Language. We discussed and debated the impact of the intentions of the asker.

I had the pleasant surprise of meeting him again at the first [Agile Tour Zurich](/blog/2018/11/report-agile-tour-zurich/) last year and I'm looking forward meeting him again in Porto this year.
